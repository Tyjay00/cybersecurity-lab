### üíª My Cybersecurity Lab Project
This repository documents the setup and configuration of my personal cybersecurity lab, a virtual environment designed for learning and practicing cybersecurity concepts. Built using VirtualBox, this lab provides a safe and isolated space to experiment with security tools, monitor system activities, and analyze potential threats without impacting my host machine.

## ‚ú® Project Overview
The core of this cybersecurity lab consists of three interconnected virtual machines and the powerful Wazuh security monitoring platform:

- **Ubuntu VM (Wazuh Manager):** The central hub of the lab, hosting the Wazuh server components (Manager, Indexer, Dashboard) for security information and event management (SIEM).

- **Kali Linux VM:** A specialized penetration testing distribution, equipped with a wide array of tools for ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment.

- **Windows 11 VM:** A representative target system that is monitored by Wazuh, allowing for real-world simulation of security events and agent deployment exercises.

## üöÄ Key Features & Setup Highlights
- **Virtualization with VirtualBox:** Utilizes Oracle VM VirtualBox to create and manage isolated virtual environments.

- **Comprehensive Network Configuration:** Detailed setup of internal networks for secure VM communication, alongside NAT for internet access where required.

- **Dynamic Disk Management:** Demonstrates the process of expanding virtual disk space to accommodate resource-intensive applications like Wazuh.

- **Wazuh Deployment:** Step-by-step installation of the Wazuh security platform for real-time threat detection, log analysis, and compliance monitoring.

- **Wazuh Agent Deployment:** Successful integration of the Wazuh agent on the Windows 11 VM for data collection and centralized monitoring.

- **Security Best Practices:** Includes steps for securing default administrative credentials for the Wazuh Dashboard.
